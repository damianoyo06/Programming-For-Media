    <h1>The Oracle</h1>
      <p class="readMore">Read More</p>
    <p class="description">The Oracle is a low-poly 3D puzzle game that challenges players with an unconventional narrative approach.
      Together with my teammates, Alana Prnjavorac, Annelies Adamache, and Kiera Loughor-Clarke, we developed a fully playable game.
      My role was to code the game's logic using the C# programming language in Unity.
      You can download The Oracle <a href="https://damianoyo.itch.io/the-oracle" target="_blank">here</a> and try it for yourself. Below, Iâ€™ve attached a teaser of the game. </p>

    <h1>Flappy Bird</h1>
    <p class="readMore">Read More</p>
    <p class="description">As the starting point of my journey with C# and Unity, I began by recreating a classic game.
      This process helped me grasp the basics of object-oriented programming.
      Gradually, I explored more complex features of Unity, and through this,
      I gained a deeper understanding of the platform, eventually reaching a level
      where I could confidently create something original and independent.
    Below I have included a snippet of in-game recording.</p>
